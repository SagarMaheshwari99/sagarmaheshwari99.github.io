Hi! I am a Compiler Engineer for the [AI Engine](https://www.xilinx.com/products/technology/ai-engine.html) at the AI Group, AMD. I am passionate about High Performance Computing and practical and efficient Machine Learning with a focus on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition.

Previously, I was a Software Developer and a researcher at Xilinx, which was later acquired by [AMD](https://www.amd.com/en.html). In June 2021, I graduated from [Institute of Technology, Nirma University](https://technology.nirmauni.ac.in/) with a B.Tech. in [Electronics and Communication Engineering](https://ec.nirmauni.ac.in/) and a Minor in [Computer Science and Engineering](https://cse.nirmauni.ac.in/). I received the academic excellence award for being in the top 10 of my graduating batch. In the summer of 2020, I worked at [Lumeo](https://lumeo.com/) as a Computer Vision intern and worked on efficient machine learning model deployment and inferencing on edge devices. Before that, in June 2019, I was one of the few students to receive a research grant from [Idea Lab](https://technology.nirmauni.ac.in/technology-research/theme/idea-lab), ITNU for pursuing independent research on [*Continuous Recognition of 3D Space Handwriting using Deep Learning*](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-33-4543-0_73) under the guidance of [Dr. Sachin Gajjar](https://technology.nirmauni.ac.in/author/sachin/).

My research interests lie in High Performance Computing, Computer Vision and Machine Learning.
